Description: MCMCixBimodal simulates random variables from a Univariate Gaussian/Cauchy Mixture Distribution. 
              The means/medians and variances/scale parameters of the 2 Gaussian/Cauchy distributions and the mixing parameter that form 
              the target mixture distribution are taken as input from the user. This package performs an effective MCMC technique that uses a 
              specially customised proposal density to simulate random variables from the target 
              distribution and plots their histogram, using Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm. 1000 Markov chains
              are simultaneously simulated by MCMC using the package. The convergence 
              rate of the algorithm is studied by the package using relevant plots. The number of iterations for each of the 1000 Markov Chains is taken as
              an input from the user. Increasing this value increases the accuracy of the simulations.
