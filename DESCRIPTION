Description: MCMCixBimodal simulates random variables from a Univariate Gaussian Mixture Distribution. 
              The means and variances of the 2 Gaussian distributions and the mixing parameter that form 
              the target mixture distribution are taken as input from the user, along with the number of 
              values to be simulated. This package performs an effective MCMC technique that uses a 
              specially customised proposal density to simulate random variables from the target 
              distribution and plot their histogram, using Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm. The convergence 
              rate of the algorithm is studied by the package using relevant plots.
